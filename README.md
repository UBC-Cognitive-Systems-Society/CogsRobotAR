Tested with Unity 2018.2.16 installed with Vuforia 7.5
Installed with both Vuforia and Android Build Components

# Releases
Each release includes both a VPN to test out the project and a zip file of starter code to work through the workshop

# Building for Android
* Ensure that Unity is installed with Android Build Components
* In the player settings, uncheck AndroidTV support
* Follow the instructions for Building here: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/mobile-touch/building-your-unity-game-android-device-testing?playlist=17138
** I used Unity's internal build system instead of gradle, it shouldn't really matter though.
